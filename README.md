# Predicting Restaurant Ratings Using Machine Learning

This project aims to build a machine learning model to predict the aggregate rating of a restaurant based on various features. The task involved preprocessing the data, selecting a regression model, training it, and evaluating its performance.

## **Project Overview**

The goal of this project is to predict the restaurant rating based on the given features such as cuisine type, location, and other relevant factors. The dataset was preprocessed, and several regression models were evaluated to determine the most accurate prediction.

## **Steps Involved**

### 1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Handled missing values
   - Encoded categorical variables into numerical form
   - Split data into training and testing sets

### 2. **Model Selection and Training**
   - Applied multiple regression algorithms:
     - **Linear Regression**
     - **Decision Tree Regression**
   - Trained models on the preprocessed data.

### 3. **Model Evaluation**
   - Evaluated the models using common regression metrics such as:
     - **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**
     - **R-squared**

### 4. **Interpretation of Results**
   - Analyzed the results to identify key factors influencing restaurant ratings.
   - Provided insights into how various features impact the overall rating.

## **Technologies Used**
- **Python** for programming
- **Pandas** for data manipulation and preprocessing
- **Scikit-learn** for machine learning algorithms
- **Matplotlib** for visualizations
