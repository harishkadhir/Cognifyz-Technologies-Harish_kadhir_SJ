# Restaurant Data Science Project

This repository contains the code for completing three machine learning tasks related to restaurants:

1. **Restaurant Rating Prediction**  
2. **Restaurant Recommendation System**  
3. **Cuisine Classification**

## Overview

The project involves three key machine learning tasks, each solving a different challenge related to restaurants:

### 1. **Restaurant Rating Prediction**
   - **Objective**: Predict the aggregate rating of a restaurant based on various features.
   - **Steps**:
     - Preprocessing the dataset (handling missing values, encoding categorical variables).
     - Splitting the data into training and testing sets.
     - Training a regression model (e.g., Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regression).
     - Evaluating the model using regression metrics like MSE and R-squared.
     - Interpreting results and identifying influential features affecting ratings.
   
   - **Model**: Decision Tree Regression (or similar).
   - **Evaluation Metrics**: Mean Squared Error, R-squared.

### 2. **Restaurant Recommendation System**
   - **Objective**: Create a recommendation system that suggests restaurants based on user preferences.
   - **Steps**:
     - Preprocessing the dataset and encoding categorical variables.
     - Determining the criteria for restaurant recommendations (e.g., cuisine type, price range).
     - Implementing a content-based filtering approach.
     - Testing the recommendation system with sample user preferences.
   
   - **Model**: Content-Based Filtering.
   - **Evaluation**: Based on quality and relevance of recommendations.

### 3. **Cuisine Classification**
   - **Objective**: Classify restaurants based on their cuisines.
   - **Steps**:
     - Preprocessing the dataset (handling missing values, encoding categorical variables).
     - Splitting the data into training and testing sets.
     - Training a classification model (e.g., Random Forest, Logistic Regression).
     - Evaluating the model using classification metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall.
     - Analyzing the model's performance across different cuisines.
   
   - **Model**: Random Forest Classifier (or similar).
   - **Evaluation Metrics**: Accuracy, Precision, Recall.
